This is a fast MC generator for physics events arising from the DVCS/BH processes.


It also calculates cross-sections

It's based around the method first done by Slava Korotkov in his paper with WDN. It uses a CFF lookup table generated by the VGG code to calculate events quickly - no integration routines are necessary which causes a code speedup, a very good thing.

The gen_events.cc is an example program as to how to call the library function dvcsbh().

It's a mess right here, because this is a version I was working on alone for the COMPASS collaboration. It needs a little bit of touchup to make it shiny and usable. You can email me to ask about anything, of course.
